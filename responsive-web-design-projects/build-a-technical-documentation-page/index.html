        <li>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
          interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</li>
        <li>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains
          distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</li>
        <li>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</li>
        <li>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the
          tutorial
          can be read off-line as well.</li>
        <li>For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python
          Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.</li>
        <li>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s
          flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.</li>

      <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files
        in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.

        If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing
        the
        testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.

        Python is just the language for you.

        You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java
        program,
        but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.

        Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C,
        and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet
        many
        things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.

        Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to
        program
        in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

        Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of
        the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.

        Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

        the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
        statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
        no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

        Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be
        available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.

        By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!

        Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.

        In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.

        The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts
        like exceptions and user-defined classes.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Invoking_the_Interpreter">
      <header>Invoking the Interpreter</header>
      <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.7 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:</p>
      <code>python3.7</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Argument_Passing">
      <header>Argument Passing</header>
      <p>When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import sys. The length of the
        list
        is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When
        -m
        module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Interactive_Mode">
      <header>Interactive Mode</header>
      <p>When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the
        secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:</p>
      <code>$ python3.7
        Python 3.7 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
        [GCC 4.8.2] on linux
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

    <section class="main-section" id="Source_Code_Encoding">
      <header>Source Code Encoding</header>
      <p>By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses
        ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the
        file.

        To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:</p>
      <code># -*- coding: encoding -*-</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python">
      <header>An Informal Introduction to Python</header>
      <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a
        prompt
        are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.

        Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line
        or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in
        examples.

        Some examples:</p>
      <code># this is the first comment
        spam = 1 # and this is the second comment
        # ... and now a third!
        text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."

      <header>Using Python as a Calculator</header>
      <p>Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
      <header>Numbers</header>
      <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C);
        parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>
      <code>>>> 2 + 2
        4
        >>> 50 - 5*6
        20
        >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
        5.0
        >>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number
        1.6
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
      <header>Strings</header>
      <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result [2]. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
      <code>>>> 'spam eggs' # single quotes
        'spam eggs'
        >>> 'doesn\'t' # use \' to escape the single quote...
        "doesn't"
        >>> "doesn't" # ...or use double quotes instead
        "doesn't"
        >>> '"Yes," they said.'
        '"Yes," they said.'
        >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
        '"Yes," they said.'
        >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
        '"Isn\'t," they said.'</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
      <header>Lists</header>
      <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of
        different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>
      <code>>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
        >>> squares
        [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="First_steps_towards_programming">
      <header>First steps towards programming</header>
      <p>Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:</p>
      <code>>>> # Fibonacci series:
        ... # the sum of two elements defines the next
        ... a, b = 0, 1
        >>> while a < 10: ... print(a) ... a, b=b, a+b ... 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 </code>
      <p>This example introduces several new features.

      The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before
      any
      of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.

      The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a
      non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than),> (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or
      equal to),>= (greater than or equal to) and != (not equal to).

      The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python
      with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed
      the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.

      The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments, floating point
      quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:</p>
      <code>>>> i = 256*256
            >>> print('The value of i is', i)
            The value of i is 65536
      </code>
      <p>The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:</p>
      <code>>>> a, b = 0, 1
            >>> while a < 1000:
            ... print(a, end=',' )
            ... a, b=b, a+b
            ... 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,
      </code>
